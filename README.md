Initial commit...

The idea behind this project is to write an interface to Arduino, and other
microcontroller directly from the web,with server located in the cloud,
the users should be able to access their house
from any location in the world. Connection between client and server is encrypted
with AES128 encryption. It should be written in as many languages as possible :)
